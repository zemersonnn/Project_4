Project 4 for Bootcamp 
House Price Predictor/
Overview: The goal of project 4 is to successfully make a house price predictor using machine learning. The problem that we are tackling is the lack of information for prices of new homes. The libraries that will be used are pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.
Approach: The plan of action consists of acquiring datasets, creating a process for modeling, modeling the data, and model optimization. Acquiring the dataset consists of gathering data from various libraries like Kaggle and Medium. 
Rationale: Developing a house price predictor using machine learning offers numerous benefits, including improved accuracy, adaptability, personalization, risk mitigation, transparency, scalability, and accessibility. By harnessing the power of data-driven insights, homebuyers can make more informed decisions, navigate the complexities of the housing market with confidence, and ultimately enhance their financial well-being. As technology continues to evolve, the integration of machine learning into real estate analytics represents a promising avenue for innovation and progress in the housing market.
Expected Outcome: The expected outcome for predicting house prices using machine learning is to use historical data and relevant features to forecast future home prices, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions in the real estate market. This analysis, driven by past trends and predictive features, aims to provide reliable estimates of future home prices, facilitating strategic planning and informed investment decisions within the real estate industry.
